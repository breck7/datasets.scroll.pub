Big(O) Complexity Classes in Programming
========================================

This dataset categorizes various Big(O) complexity classes that are commonly encountered in computer programming and algorithm analysis.

Schema
======

The notation used to describe the complexity class, such as O(n), O(log n), etc.

A brief explanation of the complexity class, often describing how the time or space requirements grow with the size of the input.

Examples of algorithms or operations that typically exhibit this level of complexity.

Data
