O(1)	complexityClasses.scroll	Execution time remains constant regardless of input size.	
O(log n)	complexityClasses.scroll	Execution time grows logarithmically in proportion to the input size.	
O(n)	complexityClasses.scroll	Execution time grows linearly with the input size.	
O(n log n)	complexityClasses.scroll	Execution time grows linearly and logarithmically with the input size.
